Prima needs image libraries to work correctly. Unix and cygwin builds rely on
existing installations of libjpeg, libungif, libtiff, libpng,
libXpm, and libX11, all of them being optional dependencies.

This binary distribution provides support for the BMP,PCX,GIF,JPEG,TIFF,PNG,XBM,XPM 
graphic formats, among others, for MSVC and cygwin builds.
