PRIGRAPH.DLL for win32
----------------------

Prima needs image libraries to work correctly. Unix and cygwin builds rely on
existing installations of libjpeg, libungif, libtiff, libpng,
libXpm, and libX11, all of them being optional dependencies.

This binary distribution provides support for the BMP,PCX,GIF,JPEG,TIFF,PNG,XBM,XPM 
graphic formats, among others, for MSVC and cygwin builds.

LINKING WITH MSVC
-----------------

Copy PRIGRAPH.LIB into your LIBPATH.

LINKING WITH CYGWIN/MINGW32
---------------------------

Copy LIBPRIGRAPH.A into your LIBPATH. If for any reason it is not recognized by
your compiler, try to reinstantiate the file from prigraph.dll by running

   dlltool -U --def prigraph.def --dllname prigraph.dll --output-lib libprigraph.a
